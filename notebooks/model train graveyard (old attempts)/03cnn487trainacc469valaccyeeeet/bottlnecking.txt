Optimization Recommendations for Your CNN Model:
1. Profiling Insights
From the profiling and training logs, the key bottlenecks are:

Convolutional Layers: The most time-consuming operations (conv2d, batch_norm, and relu).
CUDA Memory Management: Frequent memory allocations like cudaMalloc, cudaFree, and cudaLaunchKernel are slowing down execution.
2. Data Loading Improvements
Prefetching and Pinning: Use DataLoader options like pin_memory=True and num_workers=4 for faster data transfers:
python
Copy code
train_loader = DataLoader(
    ImageFolder(train_path, transform=train_transforms),
    batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True, pin_memory=True, num_workers=4
)
3. Model Adjustments
Reduce Dropout Rate: Lower Dropout(p=0.4) to p=0.2 to reduce underfitting.
Batch Normalization Tweaks:
Consider removing BatchNorm2d from the initial layers or tuning its parameters (eps, momentum).
4. Training Strategy Adjustments
Learning Rate Scheduler: Consider CosineAnnealingLR for smoother convergence:

python
Copy code
scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.CosineAnnealingLR(optimizer, T_max=10)
Training Hyperparameters:

Increase accumulation_steps to 4 or 8 to stabilize training.
Use a larger batch size (if memory allows).
5. Loss and Evaluation Metrics
Weighted Loss Adjustment:
Check if class weights are properly scaled and not over-penalizing rare classes.
Ensure CrossEntropyLoss with reduction='mean'.
6. Model Augmentation
Augmentations for Data Diversity:
python
Copy code
train_transforms = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((320, 320)),
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
    transforms.RandomRotation(30),
    transforms.ColorJitter(brightness=0.2, contrast=0.2),
    transforms.RandomResizedCrop(320, scale=(0.5, 1.0)),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=train_mean.tolist(), std=train_std.tolist())
])
7. Evaluation Improvements
Validation Metrics:
Use a validation metric tracker like Accuracy, Precision, and Recall from torchmetrics.
Evaluate only every few epochs to reduce evaluation overhead.
8. Mixed Precision Tweaks
Use torch.compile() for Faster Execution (PyTorch 2.x+):
python
Copy code
net = torch.compile(net)
9. Advanced Optimization
Enable AMP (Automatic Mixed Precision):
python
Copy code
with autocast():
    output = net(data)
    loss = criterion(output, label)
Next Steps:
Apply these adjustments incrementally.
Re-profile the model after changes.
